## HostSlim Reviews

HostSlim receives mixed customer feedback on Trustpilot with varying experiences across different service categories. Positive reviews highlight the company's competitive pricing, fast support response times, good uptime, and reliable performance for VPS and web hosting services. Customers appreciate the budget-friendly hosting options, user-friendly control panels, and the availability of 100% green hosting powered by renewable energy.

However, some customers have reported challenges including delayed dedicated server delivery times, occasional technical issues with server installations, and slow ticket response times during peak periods. A few negative reviews mention difficulties with refund processing and support communication, though these appear to be isolated incidents. Website Planet notes that HostSlim provides good value with a 14-day money-back guarantee and free test plans. The company maintains a focus on the Dutch and European markets, which may affect international support availability.
